# Grafana Dashboards

This repository contains sample Dashboards to help you with a quick start. 
They may not cover all or explicit use cases and may be extended in the future.

## Data Sources

Please note that these Dashboards require a specific Data Source configuration. 
Please consult our documentation for more input *(soonâ„¢)*.

## Dashbaords

For better overview we've decided to divide Dashboards in categories. 
For example this means you'll find Ticket specific things in Tickets and 
detailed statistics about your CTI calls on another dashboard.

## Extending / Building your own panel

To help you with fiddling, our documentation provides a page with all relevant 
elasticsearch indices and data we're saving. You can find this page here:

## Questions / Something not all right?
