This repository contains sample Dashboards to help you with a quick start. 
They may not cover all or explicit use cases and may be extended in the future.

## Data Sources

Please note that these Dashboards require a specific Data Source configuration. 
Please consult our documentation for more input *(soonâ„¢)*.

## Dashbaords

For better overview we've decided to put each dashboard into its own folder. 
Every folder contains the ``.json`` file needed for importing and a screen shot 
for a better idea what the dashboard is about.

## Extending / Building your own panel

To help you with fiddling, our documentation provides a page with all relevant 
elasticsearch indices and data we're saving. You can find this page here:

## Questions / Something not all right?
